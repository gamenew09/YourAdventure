A remake of AdventureCraft for updated times 1.7.10+. Right now this is in a very early stage, so... Just wait.

## Currently Implemented AdventureCraft Features
* Cursor - Allows a region selection. (Right-Click - Set Position One, Shift-Right Click - Set Position Two)
* Hammer - Places all blocks in a region with the material right clicked on, for now you shift-right click to erase the selection. Will implement Eraser then remove this functionality.
